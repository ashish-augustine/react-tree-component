1. Working of the demo app

From a ‘Parent Folder’, we can navigate to the ‘Sub-Folders’ and then when the sub-folders are finished,  a ‘Grey Car Icon’ is shown. 
When the grey car icon is opened, then comes the ‘Color Car Icons’ which is basically the end node of that branch. 
Also, the items are drag & droppable. 
The end node is coloured. 
Upon clicking each folder / node, that name is displayed in the right pane. 
[NB: In this project, I have used a dummy array with some random values for naming the folders and its sub folders, except for the first folder. ]




2. Choice of libraries

While working on this project,  I have chosen React Arborist Library.

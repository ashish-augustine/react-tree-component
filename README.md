1. Working of the demo app

From a ‘Parent Folder’, we can navigate to the ‘Sub-Folders’ and then when the sub-folders are finished,  a ‘Grey Car Icon’ is shown. 
When the grey car icon is opened, then comes the ‘Color Car Icons’ which is basically the end node of that branch. 
Also, the items are drag & droppable. 
The end node is coloured. 
Upon clicking each folder / node, that name is displayed in the right pane. 
[NB: In this project, I have used a dummy array with some random values for naming the folders and its sub folders, except for the first folder. ]




2. Choice of libraries

While working on this project,  I have chosen React Arborist Library.


 









## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

1. Working of the demo app

From a ‘Parent Folder’, we can navigate to the ‘Sub-Folders’ and then when the sub-folders are finished,  a ‘Grey Car Icon’ is shown. 
When the grey car icon is opened, then comes the ‘Color Car Icons’ which is basically the end node of that branch. 
Also, the items are drag & droppable. 
The end node is coloured. 
Upon clicking each folder / node, that name is displayed in the right pane. 
[NB: In this project, I have used a dummy array with some random values for naming the folders and its sub folders, except for the first folder. ]




2. Choice of libraries

While working on this project, the choice of libraries which I had was 

React dnd<br />
React beautiful dnd <br />
RC-Tree Library<br />
React D3 Tree Component<br />
React Material UI (MUI)<br />
React Arborist Library<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


## Reasons for choosing React Arborist Library! <br />

Personally, I have tested the React Arborist Library for Tree Component with thousands of data and the library is working just smooth & stable which makes it absolutely perfect choice!!<br /><br />

Apart from this, the other features of the library are:

This library provides all the common features expected in a tree. <br />
You can select one or many nodes to drag and drop into new positions,<br />
Open and close folders, <br />
Render an inline form for renaming, <br />
Efficiently show thousands of items, <br />
Provide our own node renderer to control the style.<br /><br />
 
<br />
